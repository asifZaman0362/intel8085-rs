# intel8085-rs
A simulator for the Intel 8085 microprocessor complete with an assembler and hopefully, a nice web-socket based UI allowing for collaborative experimentation.
This is more of a learning experience so there are no guarantees and its most definitely going to be full of bugs. Working on this project will hopefully teach 
me a lot about CPU architecture and the 8085 in particular which is a wonderful piece of technology. And implementing a web interface might also prove to be an 
effective way of learning about websockets and web development in general. I want to use a web-assembly based UI framework like yew but if it turns out to be too 
tedious, I'll probably just stick to some plain old templating supported by actix-web (which is what I'm using for the web-backend) instead.
